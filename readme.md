# vmt

> üåÄ Lightweight Bash CLI for managing KVM virtual machines using `libvirt`, `cloud-init`, and `terraform`.

---

## üõ† What It Does

`vmt` automates the lifecycle of local KVM virtual machines through a simple command-line interface. It uses:

* **KVM/QEMU** - fast, native Linux virtualization
* **libvirt** - VM orchestration (domains, pools, networks)
* **Terraform** - declarative configuration and lifecycle control
* **cloud-init** - inject SSH keys and configure VMs on first boot
* **pure Bash** - no Python, Go, or compiled binaries

Once the image is cached, everything runs offline and locally - ideal for air-gapped, reproducible, or automated setups.

---

## üß∞ Installation

Install `vmt` using the official installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opensecurity/vmt/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will:

* Download the latest version of the `vmt` script into `~/.vmt`
* Link it as `vmt` into `~/.local/bin/`
* Make it executable and ready to use

---

## üîß Dependencies

`vmt` relies on standard tools available on most Linux distributions:

| Tool            | Role                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `bash`          | Shell environment                     |
| `virsh`         | libvirt CLI for domains, networks     |
| `qemu-system`   | Hypervisor engine for VM execution    |
| `terraform`     | Declarative infrastructure management |
| `cloud-localds` | Generate cloud-init seed disks        |
| `ssh` / `scp`   | Key injection and access              |
| `curl`          | Download base OS images               |

A `vmt doctor` command is planned to automatically detect and verify dependencies for RHEL and Debian-based systems.

---

## üì¶ Supported Distributions

Out-of-the-box support:

* Ubuntu 24.04 (Minimal Cloud Image)
* AlmaLinux 9 (Generic Cloud)
* RockyLinux 9 (Generic Cloud)

More distributions can be added by editing the `DISTRO` case logic in the script.

---

## üöÄ CLI Usage

```bash
vmt <action> <vm_name> [distro] [ram_mb] [cpus] [disk_gb]
```

## üóÇ File Structure

Each VM is created under:

```
~/vms/<vm_name>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qemu/images/      # Disk image
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qemu/seed/        # cloud-init seed.img
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cloudinit/        # user-data and meta-data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform/        # Terraform definition
```

Global:

* `~/vms/.images/`: Cached base OS images
* `~/vms/.ssh/id_ed25519`: Shared SSH key pair
* `~/vms/logs/*.log`: Logs for each VM run

---

## üîê SSH Access

All VMs are configured with:

* `devops` user
* Public key injected via `cloud-init`
* `NOPASSWD` sudo access
* QEMU guest agent installed and enabled

Example:

```bash
vmt ssh myvm
```

Or directly:

```bash
ssh -i ~/vms/.ssh/id_ed25519 devops@<ip>
```

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html
Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

## üß† Implementation Notes

* Cloud-init handles provisioning, so no guest image modification is needed
* All disk images use QCOW2 with base + diff layers for efficiency
* `qemu-guest-agent` is installed by default for IP resolution and shutdown
* Logs are captured per-VM in `~/vms/.logs/`
* `trap` and `set -euo pipefail` ensure reliable scripting behavior
